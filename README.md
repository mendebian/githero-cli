# GitHero CLI

**GitHero** is an interactive Git CLI designed for developers who are tired of remembering Git commands or dealing with bad GUIs.

It guides you through common Git actions using simple menus, smart defaults, and clear prompts — with **almost no typing required**.

> You focus on what you want to do. GitHero handles the Git commands.

## Why GitHero?

* No need to memorize Git commands
* Interactive menus instead of flags
* Smart defaults (branch, rebase, gitignore)
* Safe operations with confirmations for destructive actions
* Works perfectly in the terminal (Windows, macOS, Linux)

GitHero **does not replace Git** — it makes Git easier to use.
